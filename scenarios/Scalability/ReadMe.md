#Scalability

Scalability of the approach is evaluated using the performance of the controller using the sceanrio gamma. 

- 5 random seeds
- With termination condition- eps of 0.01 or 500 acquisitions.
- This has to be run on the same processor. 

## Why?

1. Show people the bad things about this approach 
2. It is easy to scale, but as you scale up, these are the problems you run into. 

We do not want to think about the choice of ideal controller placement problem. That would involve us to exhaustively simulate everything that is happing and pick the best.
